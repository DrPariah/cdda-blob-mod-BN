# cdda-blob-mod-BN
A conversion of Maddremor's mod to work with BN. Only change I did, other than to update flags and such, was to remove a Clarivoyance item (the Ground Effect Scanner) because I wasn't sure how to make it work. It's available in the original if someone wants to restore it. Go star the original, please, Maddremor does good work (https://github.com/Maddremor/cdda-blob-mod).
